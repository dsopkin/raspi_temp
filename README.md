# Raspberry Pi temperature sensor script

Simple python script for commecting a DS18B20 temperature sensor with a Raspberry Pi. It can print either the temperature (configurable for Celcius or Farenheit) or the temperature and a timestamp.


## Getting Started

I followed this guide to set up the temperature sensor, if you have not already. It can be found here: 
		
[Adafruit Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-11-ds18b20-temperature-sensing/hardware)


### Prerequisites

You will need: 
	* a Rasperry Pi with SSH access
	* a DS18B20 temperature sensor


### Installing

You'll want to install modprobe.

```
$ apt-get install modprobe
```


Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
